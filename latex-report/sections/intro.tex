\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Brief Introduction}
An election for president of the United States happens every four years. Before the general election, most candidates for president go through a series of state primaries and caucuses. Though primaries and caucuses are run differently, they both serve the same purpose. They let the states choose the major political partiesâ€™ nominees for the general election\cite{usagov}. 

\subsection{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item To monitor polling data for the Democratic Party primary candidates
    \item To read the polling data from source into a dataframe, filter and plot polling data over time and to run analysis and prediction tools using R script 
    \item To plot the fundraising for Democratic candidates
    \item To plot the number of delegates awarded for candidates(state wise)
\end{itemize}
