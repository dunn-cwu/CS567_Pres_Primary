\subsection{Polling}
The poll data is collected and plotted for top five democratic candidates(Biden, Sanders, Warren, Bloomberg and Buttigieg). Data is plotted for both A rated and for all the polls as displayed in figures \ref{Updated-Polling-Data-1}, \ref{A-rated-polls} and \ref{All-rated-polls}.

Figure \ref{A-rated-polls} displays the support for candidates collected from A rated polls. At the end of  South Carolina Primary , it is observed that Sanders has the highest percentage of support is the highest and Buttigieg has the lowest percentage of support.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{All-rated-polls} shows support for candidates until Super Tuesday from all rated polls. Biden's support shows a drop, making Biden the top candidate with highest percentage of support and Buttigieg with the lowest support percentage.

Figure \ref{scatter-A-rated} shows support for candidates until South Carolina Primary. A slight drop is observed in Sanders' percentage of support after Nevada Caucus. Though there's a steady increase in Warren's support after Nevada caucus and South Carolina Primary, she still has the lowest percentage of support.

Figure \ref{scatter-all} shows support for candidates until Super Tuesday. There is a steady increase in Sanders' percentage of support after South Carolina Primary. There is a sharp increase in Biden's percentage of support after South Carolina Primary,almost on par with Sanders.
